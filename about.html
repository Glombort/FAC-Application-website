        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am a recent graduate in Mathematics from University College London (UCL) with an enthusiasm for
           technology and problem solving and excellent communication skills. My experience working as an intern
           and a coding teacher highlights my ability to translate concepts into real world solutions. </p>

          <h2>&#x1F4BC; Experience</h2>
          <p><h3>Internships with UCL Mathematics Department:</h3>
            <h4>STACK Intern with UCL Mathematics Department – STACK focussed team: June 2021-September 2021</h4>
            Experienced member of the programming team developing online learning tools supporting the Mathematics Department’s focus on hybrid learning.<br>
            Utilized STACK to implement online automated assessments for undergraduate students gaining a more advanced knowledge of Maxima, HTML and LaTeX<br>
            Established excellent rapport with academic staff, with increased responsibilities including leadership of work packages to develop, adapt and improve online assessments<br>
            Organised and quality assured work packages undertaken by junior members of the team e.g. Bug-fixing and automating standardised formatting of assessments using Python.<br>
            Proactively learnt JSXGraph (a JavaScript graphing library) to create innovative fully interactive automated graphing assessments, not previously utilized by other programmers on the team.<br> 
            <h4>Connected Learning Student Intern with UCL Mathematics Department: July 2020-September 2020</h4>
            Programming team member developing online learning tools to facilitate the new demand for online learning in the wake of COVID-19.<br>
            Rapidly and independently gained a working knowledge of Maxima (a computer algebra software), HTML, and LaTeX. Utilised my mathematical skills to code and implement complex interactive questions for effective remote learning through the Virtual Learning Environment plugin STACK<br>
            Developed strong communicative skills by liaising in a range of formats with academic staff (including PhD students and Lecturers) who lacked experience of STACK. Proactively used my strong attention to detail to ensure translation of academic staff’s preliminary ideas successfully into comprehensible and well-formatted assessments.<br>
            High levels of responsibility and organisation based solely upon my own initiative to meet the strict deadlines imposed by the timing of students returning to university</p>
            <p><h4>Teacher with Cypher Coders:  2019-2021</h4>
            Taught computer skills and block and text-based coding to classes of up to 25 children aged 5-14. Conveyed complex computational ideas in an inspiring and creative way to children with no technical knowledge<br>
            Demonstrated the ability to adapt communication style to suit parents, colleagues, and students in a one-to-one and large group format<br>
            Responsibility for the care, supervision and safeguarding of a large number of students<br>
