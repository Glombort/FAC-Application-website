        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am a recent graduate in Mathematics from University College London (UCL) with an enthusiasm for
           technology and problem solving and excellent communication skills. My experience working as an intern
           and a coding teacher highlights my ability to translate concepts into real world solutions. </p>

          <h2>&#x1F393;	Education</h2>
          <h3>University College London</h3>
          <p><b>BSc in Mathematics – 2.1 Graduated</b><br>
            I’ve just completed my mathematics degree where I focused whenever possible on computational modules as these aspects of the course really excited me. These included computational methods and computer programming in Python, machine learning for Domain Specialists and undertaking a mathematical methods project in Python.</p>
            <h3>Wyggeston & Queen Elizabeth I College, Leicester</h3>
            <p>  2016-2018, A Levels: <br>Maths (A*), Further Maths (A*), Physics (A), Chemistry (A)
            </p>

          <h2>&#x1F4BC; Experience</h2>
          <h3>Teacher with Cypher Coders:  2019-2021</h3>
          <p>I am a teacher who inspires children to learn the language of the future through creatively themed coding camps. I teach students between the ages of 5-12+ and take them through exciting computing curriculums and prepare them for the digital future ahead. I am responsible for the care and supervision of all of my students and have a responsible and conscientious attitude towards safeguarding children. My responsibilities also include setting up the classroom and preparing equipment and activities. I teach across various locations in London.</p>
          <h3>Mentoring students in STEM</h3>
          <p>As an A level student I volunteered to support first and second year sixth-form students who needed extra help with the mathematics course content. I supported these students to engage with the maths curriculum, explain more complex ideas in simple terms and prepare them for their A levels.</p>
          <h3>Internships with UCL Mathematics Department:</h3>
            <h4>STACK Intern  – STACK focussed team: June 2021-September 2021</h4>
            <h4>Connected Learning Student Intern: July 2020-September 2020</h4>
            <p>I thrived as part of an internationally based team of programmers, lecturers and PhD students working to develop online learning tools. Together we had to adapt to new situations and speedily facilitate the new demand for online learning at University College London in the wake of COVID-19 and a new focus on hybrid learning.</p>
            <p>I used my drive and initiative to independently gain a working knowledge of Maxima (a computer algebra software), HTML, and LaTeX. I used my mathematical skills to code and implement complex interactive questions for effective remote learning through the Virtual Learning Environment plugin STACK. I also proactively learnt JSXGraph (a JavaScript graphing library) to create innovative fully interactive automated graphing assessments. This had never been used by other programmers on the team.</p>
            <p>It was a real challenge to translate the preliminary ideas of the academic staff into comprehensible and well-formatted assessments, but this taught me strong communication skills liaising with PhD students and Lecturers who lacked IT experience. </p>
