        <h1>Why I'm applying</h1>
        <p>I was motivated to apply for this course because I am dedicated to a career in web development. I’m excited to utilise my skills in
           problem-solving and critical thinking and my love of tech into my career. Working in web development would incorporate these skills
            with so many opportunities for continuous learning. I really enjoy keeping up with new technology as it evolves, and I’m enthusiastic
             for a career which would enable me to stay up to date as the field develops. The online experience has become an essential to the
              success of every business and organization across all sectors. By learning web development I will have opportunities to work in a
               wide range of areas from a startup tech company, the public sector, healthcare, finance or a combination of all these. </p>
        <p>A career in web development offers me the opportunity to learn from a large international tech community. I’m really excited by the
           ethos of Founders and Coders, offering opportunities to diverse developers from all backgrounds and cultures which will create an
            inspiring team. Spending two years of primary school at an international school in Stockholm, Sweden had a major impact on me. I was
             part of a group of students from a wide range of countries and cultures, learning new languages and gaining experiences which was
              really exciting. This motivated me to embrace opportunities to work with and learn from people from a diverse range of backgrounds,
               both as a student and as a teacher whenever I can. This has made working with the Founders and Coders team really attractive to me.  </p>
        <p>The focus on peer-led learning at Founders and Coders is something that was really important to me as tackling a problem with others
           can be so rewarding. Working as a team is something that I really thrive on, be it solving an escape room with friends and family or
            working with my peers to understand problems from different and varied perspectives. I love working in a cooperative, supportive 
            environment, generating ideas together and growing as a team. At school I was a volunteer mentor, supporting and helping other students
             with their learning and so often found I was learning and growing myself through the process. I’m excited to continue learning in a
              peer-led environment as part of this course and continue my personal growth and play a part in others’ development too. </p>
        <p>I recognise that we all have a responsibility for creating a more inclusive environment within the technology sector, moving away from
           the traditional stereotypes and ensuring that we remove the barriers to create a diverse wide pool of talent and an environment where
            everyone feels respected. As a white cis male I realise the importance of being an ally to all minorities in the industry, being aware
             of the impact my actions have on others and making a positive change in the workplace by encouraging an atmosphere of respect. In my
              role as a coding tutor, teaching groups of primary school girls, and A level students I always ensure that I value people for who they
               are and what they bring and encourage them to challenge and remove the barriers they may see in being part of the technology sector.
                Through writing my website for Founders and Coders, I was really interested in what I learnt about web accessibility, and that as 
                developers we should have a duty to make our code accessible for all. </p>
