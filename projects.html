        <h1>Projects</h1>
        <p>I really enjoy challenging myself to complete various projects and prompts here are some I have completed for <a href="#personal-projects">personal use</a> and <a href="#founders-prompts">prompts for Founders and Coders</a></p>

          <h2>Founders and Coders Prompts and Requirements</h2>
          <p>These were the main prompts we were challenged to complete for the founders and coders application requirements. These gave me a great grounding in coding languages and skills for web-development. freeCodeCamp was a great way to
            learn how to learn these basics and more on a great and free platform. My <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/glamb3rt">public profile</a> lists what parts I have completed for it.

            <h3>Functions</h3>
            <p>This prompt created three functions in JavaScript getting a good idea of using strings within functions. The functions were:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <h4>Greet the user</h4>
                <p>This took in a string as input and returned Hello with the input string attached.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h4>Find the type of argument passed</h4>
                <p>This took any argument and would return the data type of argument passed, of which 5 were possible; String, Number, Boolean, Object and Function.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h4>Find the length of a string passed through</h4>
                <p>This would take a string as an argument and return with the length of the whole string including whitespaces. It could also take in objects such as arrays and return the number of elements in said array.</p>
              </li>

            <h3>Number Functions</h3>
            <p>This prompt created 7 different functions getting a key understanding in taking number inputs with JavaScript. These functions were</p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <h4>Summing Two Numbers</h4>
                <p>Taking an input of 2 numbers and returning the result of them added together</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h4>Add and Multiply</h4>
                <p>Accepts an input of 4 numbers and the first two and last two, returning the product of these two sums.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h4>Return Larger</h4>
                <p>Accepts the input of two numbers returning the larger of the two</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h4>Sum of elements</h4>
                <p>Takes an array as input returing the sum of the numbers in the array</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h4>Squaring a number</h4>
                <p>Accepts one input and returns the square of that input</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h4>Odd or Even</h4>
                <p>Accepts one input and returns whether it is 'Odd' or 'Even'</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h4>Sum of Positive</h4>
                <p>Takes an array and returns the sum of all the positive numbers in the array, if this is imposible it returns 0</p>
              </li>

            <h3>DOM Manipulation</h3>
            <p>The focus of this prompt was to firstly get comfortable with the DOM (Document Object Model), but also to create
              a 'codename validator'.<br> This validator takes a string as an input and returns whether it is an acceptable codename
              or not. There were three criteria for the codename to be valid. It had to firstly have at least 6 characters, it
              also had to have at least one lowercase letter and one uppercase letter, and finally it had to have at least 2 numbers.<br>
              This prompt was a great way to understand how each part of the html, js and css work together.

            <h3>Arrays and Array Methods</h3>
            <p>This prompt was similar to DOM Manipulation but with more of a focus on some neat JavaScript functionality
              for arrays. The prompt required using two different array methods the filter method and the reduce method.<br>
              The filter method was used to 'filter' the array only keeping multiples of two for the user.<br>
              The reduce method was used to sum all numbers in the array.<br>
              These were both really interesting to find swifter ways of using functions on arrays. It was also a great
              way to think about what a user could enter and how to get around parts of what a user inputs that are unnecessary
              or incorrect.

            <h3>Personal Website</h3>
            <p>
              This was the final requirement for Founders and Coders.<br>
              This was a great way to throw myself into web-development and create something personal about me. Throughout creating this website I found lots of different ways to use what I had learned throughout all the other prompts and add them to this.<br>
              Such as altering my tags and colours to make it an accessible website. This was implemented by using semantic html tags and <a href="https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/" target="_blank">Webaims</a> contrast checker to give the website a AAA from Google Lighthouse development tools.<br>
              Overall this website was super fun to create and will definitely be utilised in my future.

            <h3>Python Film Chooser</h3>
            <p>
              This was a fun build to code. It used my knowledge of python as well as my love for films.<br>
              The basic premise of this project was to swiftly get up to 5 random films, from a handmade database of films I'm wanting to watch, that fill certain criteria.<br>
              The most recent update to this was to add a choice of multiple genres, which updates with the number of films in that category, to really narrow down what I wanted to watch.
